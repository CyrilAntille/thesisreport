\chapter*{Acknowledgement}

I would like to thank my supervisors Associate Professor Are Jensen and Professor Andreas Austeng for offering me such an interesting thesis topic and for their incredible support during its development.
This thesis was not always easy to conciliate with a time-consuming and challenging job, but Are and Andreas have both been extremely patient and understanding with my situation.

Besides their contribution to this thesis, they, along with Professor Sverre Holm, have introduced me to the DSB research group and have always encouraged me to join their seminars and events. I sincerely congratulate them, and every member of the DSB group, for maintaining such an excellent atmosphere and will of mutual help within that group.

When I joined UiO for a Master program, Andreas gave me precious advice about the structure of my program, from the choice of courses to the topic for Master thesis. I also owe my current job position to Andreas' and Sverre's courses and their relationship with industries in related domains.

I would also like to thank my parents for their moral and financial support and for encouraging me to challenge myself and take risks.
Finally, thanks to Mary for her patience during those long days, and nights, of work.
